<p>I am a junior Business Administration major at Bob Jones University. This summer I will be interning at Spruce Lake Retreat as an Administrative Assistant. I hope to gain some valuable experience as I work there this summer.</p>


<p>Coffee plays quite the role in my life. Whenever I study, I either go to a local coffee shop or make coffee in my room. With my busines major, I hope to own my own coffee shop someday. Here is a link to one of my favorite study spots: <a href="https://www.stbdowntown.com/">Spill the Beans</a></p>
<p>I love hiking, traveling, and going to the beach.</p3>
